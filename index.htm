	<h1> The NES Codex </h1>
    
	<p> 
    	This HTML project is a compendium of technical knowledge regarding the Nintendo Entertainment System. It contains diagrams and documents outlining the system's components, programming, and operation. This codex will stand as a testament to the system's importance in the history of video game technology, and to the fact that I am a gigantic nerd for knowing all of this.
    </p>
    <h2> Overview </h2>
    <p>
    	The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was released in 1983 in Japan (as the Family Computer, or "Famicom"), and in 1985 in the United States. Built around the 8-bit architecture of a modified MOS 6502, the system's technology was an exemplar of the era, featuring a fast (for the time) 1.79 MHz processor, a programmable sound generator, and a video chip geared towards 2D tiled graphics and sprites. But the NES also had features that were state-of-the-art for the time: a primative form of Direct Memory Access, a sound chip capable of playing back digitized recordings, and a hardware configuration specifically designed to allow for smooth screen scrolling, a feat that even the strongest PCs of the day stuggled to pull off. Its power, strong library of games, reasonable price and lack of competition ensured that Nintendo had a foothold in the hearts and living rooms of America.
